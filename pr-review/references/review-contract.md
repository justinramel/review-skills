# Review contract

This is the rubric every reviewer applies.
Pair it with the stance in [`reviewer-role.md`](reviewer-role.md): that file defines who you are and how you approach your assigned scope; this file defines what you check and return.

## What to review

The brief assigns exactly one review mode:

- **`standards-only`**: review the whole diff on Standards only.
- **`spec-only`**: review the whole diff on Spec only.
- **`architecture-only`**: review the whole diff only through [`architecture-review.md`](architecture-review.md).

Never run an axis the assigned mode excludes.

### Standards, in priority order

1. **The repo's own rules** - its `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or coding standards.
   Cite the file and rule for each finding.
   A breach here can be a **hard violation**.
2. **The smell baseline below** - applies even when the repo documents nothing.
   Every baseline finding is a **judgement call** ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation.
   A documented repo standard always wins: where the repo endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress it.
   Skip anything the repo's tooling already enforces - a linter finding is not a review finding.

Match each against the diff - *what it is* → *how to fix*:

- **Mysterious Name**: a name that doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design is murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape in more than one hunk or file. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move it onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields/params keep travelling together. → bundle them into one type.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive standing in for a domain concept. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs. → replace with polymorphism, or one shared map.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files. → gather what changes together.
- **Divergent Change**: one file edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction/hooks for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class/function that mostly just delegates. → cut it, call the real target.
- **Refused Bequest**: an implementation that ignores most of what it inherits. → prefer composition.
- **Bolted-on Branch**: a special case inserted into a flow that had none - a one-off boolean, a nullable mode, a "temporary" `if`. → push it behind its own abstraction, or make it the default flow with fewer exceptions.
  This is how a clean flow becomes spaghetti one PR at a time; treat it as design, not style.
- **Papered-over Boundary**: a cast, an `any`, or an optional standing in for an invariant nobody made explicit, so a silent fallback hides the real contract. → make the boundary explicit.

Tests get three smells of their own:

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or asserts through a side channel (querying the DB instead of the interface).
  The tell: it breaks on refactor when behaviour did not.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does, so it passes by construction.
  Expected values must come from an independent source - a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Wrong seam**: the test sits below the public behaviour boundary it claims to defend.

### Spec

The supplied requirement source is the source of truth for this axis.
Use Jira, a linked issue, or a user-supplied specification when available; otherwise use the labeled PR or commit-message declared-intent fallback.
Report, quoting the applicable source line when one exists:

- **Missing**: requested behaviour absent or partial.
- **Creep**: behaviour or files nobody asked for.
- **Wrong**: a requirement that looks implemented but whose behaviour does not hold up.

Declared intent is weaker than an external requirement. State that limitation in the report rather than skipping the Spec axis.

### Architecture and DDD

This axis always runs over the complete diff. The `architecture-only` reviewer applies its Architecture lens and applies its DDD lens only to domain-bearing code. Repository architecture decisions take precedence over the general lens.

Do not reassess repository style or requirement coverage on this axis. Report design problems only when the diff provides concrete evidence and a proportionate correction.

## Severity

- **blocker**: must fix before merge, such as wrong behaviour, a security hole, data loss, or a documented-standard violation with real consequence.
- **major**: should fix before merge, such as a structural problem (Bolted-on Branch, Papered-over Boundary, unjustified Speculative Generality, broken dependency direction, or misplaced invariant ownership), missing or wrong required behaviour, material scope creep, or an implementation-coupled test guarding load-bearing behaviour.
- **minor**: worth fixing, such as a judgement-call smell, narrow test, naming problem, or documented-standard breach without material consequence.
- **nit**: cosmetic; take it or leave it.

## Verdict

- `approve`: no findings.
- `approve-with-nits`: at least one minor or nit, with no blocker or major.
- `request-changes`: at least one blocker or major.

## Output

Enforce [`../schemas/reviewer-result.schema.json`](../schemas/reviewer-result.schema.json) as the strict invocation-level output schema; this prose shape does not replace runner enforcement.

Return exactly this shape:

```json
{
  "name": "<your bucket name>",
  "files": ["<file>", "..."],
  "verdict": "approve | approve-with-nits | request-changes",
  "runtime": {
    "model": "<exact model identifier | not exposed>",
    "effort": "<exact reasoning level | not exposed>"
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "blocker|major|minor|nit",
      "location": "path:line",
      "summary": "short developer-facing defect title",
      "evidence": "observed failure and consequence, grounded in the hunk",
      "fix": "smallest correction and observable completion condition"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every finding must be ready to render as a developer action without reinterpretation. Keep `summary` short, put the concrete failure and consequence in `evidence`, and make `fix` specific enough to tell when the problem is resolved.

Report the exact runtime model and reasoning effort only when the runtime exposes them to you.
Never infer either value from the brief, configured policy, or model name.
Use `not exposed` for each unavailable value.
